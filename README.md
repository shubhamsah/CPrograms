# C programs 

This repository contains some basic programs to understand c programming language. Each program is in .C format and is directly executable. The name in each file indicates the program it contains.
You may also find the detailed question inside the program.

Programs are as per turboC compiler, hence if you use some other editors or compilers make sure to comment out #include<conio.h>, clrscr() and getch().

# What is C programming?
C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple and flexible. It is machine-independent, structured programming language which is used extensively in various applications.

C was the basics language to write everything from operating systems (Windows and many others) to complex programs like the Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter and more.

It is said that 'C' is a god's programming language. One can say, C is a base for the programming. If you know 'C,' you can easily grasp the knowledge of the other programming languages that uses the concept of 'C'

It is essential to have a background in computer memory mechanisms because it is an important aspect when dealing with the C programming language.

# Why learn C?
C' is a base language for many programming languages. So, learning 'C' as the main language will play an important role while studying other programming languages. It shares the same concepts such as data types, operators, control statements and many more. 'C' can be used widely in various applications. It is a simple language and provides faster execution.
'C' is a structured programming language in which program is divided into various modules. Each module can be written separately and together it forms a single 'C' program. This structure makes it easy for testing, maintaining and debugging processes.

'C' contains 32 keywords, various data types and a set of powerful built-in functions that make programming very efficient.

Another feature of 'C' programming is that it can extend itself. A 'C' program contains various functions which are part of a library. We can add our features and functions to the library. We can access and use these functions anytime we want in our program. This feature makes it simple while working with complex programming.

Various compilers are available in the market that can be used for executing programs written in this language.

It is a highly portable language which means programs written in 'C' language can run on other machines. This feature is essential if we wish to use or execute the code on another computer.

# How C Works?

C is a compiled language. A compiler is a special tool that compiles the program and converts it into the object file which is machine readable. After the compilation process, the linker will combine different object files and creates a single executable file to run the program. The following diagram shows the execution of a 'C' program
Nowadays, various compilers are available online, and you can use any of those compilers. The functionality will never differ and most of the compilers will provide the features required to execute both 'C' and 'C++' programs.

Following is the list of popular compilers available online:

Clang compiler
MinGW compiler (Minimalist GNU for Windows)
Portable 'C' compiler
Turbo C


# Summary
'C' was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972.
It is a robust language.
It is a low programming level language close to machine language
It is widely used in the software development field.
It is a procedure and structure oriented language.
It has the full support of various operating systems and hardware platforms.
Many compilers are available for executing programs written in 'C'.
A compiler compiles the source file and generates an object file.
A linker links all the object files together and creates one executable file.
It is highly portable.
